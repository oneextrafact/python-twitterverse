    "Who does Guido Van Rossum follow? Originally I made the mistake of using \"followers\" instead of \"following\", don't do that! Also, because I find it really confusing to talk about followers and following, I'm going to refer to the accounts that GVR follows as his \"subscriptions\". GVR subscribes to just over 500 acccounts. Conveniently, the user objects from tweepy map very nicely to pandas dataframes. A little pandas magic with json_normalize lets us explode the \"public_metrics\" dictionary into new columns in our frame. "

    "We can take a look around at the accounts that Guido is following. They have a very wide range of followers, from 16 to 19,250,000. At the top end, some of the accounts are for celebrities, including: \n",

    "- Edward Snowden\n",
    "- Samantha Power, former US Ambassador to the UN\n",
    "- Dave Matthews\n",
    "- Grant Imahara\n",
    "- Leonard Nimoy\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see a lot of organizations, such as Meta, BBC Breaking News, the Mars Rover, etc. It is interesting that so many of these accounts have very small subscription counts of their own, though, much more in line with typical people. Al Gore, for instance, has 2.9 million followers but is subscribing to just 40 accounts himself. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the subscriptions for these accounts because if one of them is following GVR back, it's a pretty crucial indicator that they are part of the python universe. In such a case it would be useful to see their own subscriptions, as it gives us a sense of where they are / what they're interested in in the Python ecosystem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are left with a problem, though. If we tried to get the subscriptions of GVR's subscriptions, we would have 508,982 user records to sort through. There would be a lot of duplication in there for certain, but to get the list itself would be a difficult problem. The twitter api will return a max of 1000 followers per call, and there is a rate limit of 15 calls in 15 minutes. Getting the entire list, then, would take about 5 days! To get under this limit, we will need to take a different approach. We could consider: \n",
    "\n",
    "- taking a sample of the followers, knowing that this will leave us with missing nodes in the network. \n",
    "- limiting ourselves to 1000 followers max from each follower, which will leave us with nodes and edges missing in our network. \n",
    "- testing each account for the likelihood that it is a person rather than an institution or organization; we are more interested in people for this exploration, and perhaps that number is much smaller than the total.\n",
    "- parsing the user's description for mentions of Python or one of the more popular libraries in the ecosystem (e.g. Django)\n",
    "- taking an incremental approach, adding people that we \"know\" to our network and choosing next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm kind of curious about the last approach. For example, It would be interesting to see the people who both Wes McKinney (creator of Pandas) and Guido Van Rossum follow. We can search for Wes in the followers list and, sure enough, there he is. Luckily for us he has just under 1000 users so we can retrieve his followers with one call to the API. "

    "Having done so, we can now see some accounts that are followed by all 3 individuals. There are 6 accounts in total. One of these is for Jessica McKellar, who I recognize as a major contributor to the Twisted python library. I did a little research and saw that she was also at one point head of the Python Software Foundation. Interestingly, a lot of the individuals on the list have very small subscription accounts. The exception is Nick Coghlan, a CPython developer. There is also an indivdual, Alex Gaynor, who doesn't subscribe to anyone, but to whom many people are subscribed. This is much more the pattern of a media organization than a person, which is most curious. Between all these individuals, there are just over 4500 subscriptions. Let's get 'em all and call it the end of the day for the source of our network. "
